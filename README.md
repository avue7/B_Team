# B_Team

This was a project in my Advanced Computer Security Class (CINS 548) taught at Chico State. I was the main person that worked on this project, however, I did have a partner to start this project with. This project demonstrates my willingness to learn different languages to bring an idea out to life. This demonstrates my Python knowledge at the time. This project uses a Raspberry PI and webcam along with the open source OpenCV for helping with detecting a stranger. Basically we train the OpenCV AI to recognize our faces and send us an alert if the person in front of the camera is not one of us. I later then developed this project further by adding my family members photos with different background lighting and facial hair. Fine tuned it more, and am still currently using it. This project was fun and such a cost-effective solution to a real problem.
